# Rust-server

This project is a template setting up a Rust pipeline based on Luca Palmieri's book https://www.zero2prod.com/.

It holds a docker image that executes tarpaulin in a non Linux environment.

The image is for compilation of static Rust binaries, so you might have to adapt that to your needs.
